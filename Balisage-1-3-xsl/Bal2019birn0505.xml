    <title>The integration of XML databases and content management systems in digital
        editions</title>
    <subtitle>Understanding eXist-db through Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups</subtitle>
    <info>
        <abstract>
            <para>We have identified four models for integrating digital edition content into
                eXist-db [<xref linkend="eXist-db"/>], which are, in decreasing order of eXist-db
                dependence: 1) TEI Publisher [<xref linkend="teiPublisher"/>], 2) the eXist-db app
                framework using HTML templating [<xref linkend="templating"/>], 3) the eXist-db app
                framework without HTML templating [<xref linkend="webapp"/>] (similar to Joe
                Wicentowski's Punch project [<xref linkend="punch"/>]), and 4) using Apache [<xref
                    linkend="apache"/>] and PHP [<xref linkend="php"/>] to mediate between the user
                and eXist-db, so that eXist-db provides only XML database services. Our presentation
                will examine and compare these ways of conceptualizing and implementing the
                infrastructure for a digital edition. Each of them has advantages and disadvantages,
                primarily from the perspective of sustainability, and those concerns apply to
                edition frameworks generally, and are therefore not specific to eXist-db.</para>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>In the 1980s Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, long owned by the Hershey Corporation and one
            of the best selling and most popular candy products in the US (<xref linkend="upton"/>),
            deployed an advertising campaign that portrayed the idea of eating chocolate and peanut
            butter together as a serendipitous pleasure. In one television advertisement (<xref
                linkend="reeses"/>), two persons accidentally walk into each other on the street, he
            eating a chocolate bar and she (perhaps surprisingly) eating peanut butter out of a jar
            with her finger. They collide, the chocolate bar winds up embedded in the peanut butter,
            and they protest, in unison: <quote>You got your chocolate in my peanut butter"</quote>
            and <quote>You got peanut butter on my chocolate!</quote> They both then,
            simultaneously, realize that they like the taste of the combination, and proclaim, still
            in unison, <quote>Delicious!</quote>, as an older man (apparently a grocer; he wears an
            apron) suddenly materializes between them, standing uncomfortably close and silently
            ogling the packaged Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups that he holds up (for the camera; it is
            behind the field of view of the two principals).</para>

        </figure>
        <para>Meanwhile, in a galaxy far, far away, the eXist-db XML database was born in <emphasis
                role="bold">[EXPAND]</emphasis>. Since its inception, eXist-db has provided the
            services one expects from any database management system (DBMS): it stores records (XML
            documents), builds persistent indexes, supports retrieval with a query language
            (XQuery), and provides the housekeeping functionality (e.g., user authentication) those
            processes require. eXist-db is commonly hosted inside an HTTP server and servlet
            container (it ships with <xref linkend="Jetty"/>, but other hosts are also supported),
            which mediates between the user and the eXist-db functionality, as is illustrated in
            this image from <xref linkend="exist-book"/>:</para>
        <figure xml:id="exist-book-jetty"
            xreflabel="eXist web applicaation  platform architecture (Siegel and Retter 2014: 72)">
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata format="jpg" fileref="jetty.jpg" width="40%"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>Since its early years users have been able to interact with eXist-db by communicating
            directly with the Jetty server, and over time eXist-db has increasingly come to support
            features that are more commonly associated with a Content Management System (CMS) than
            with a database, such as themes, templates, and page management (not just data resource
            management). We might consider the eXist-db core functionality, the DBMS services at the
            innermost layer of an eXist-db installation, as analogous to the peanut butter center of
            a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, and the Jetty servlet container, which can also provide CMS
            services, as the outer layer of chocolate. But the analogy does not depend only on the
            fact that the eXist-db DBMS services are wrapped, as it were, inside Jetty’s CMS ones.
            Peanut butter and chocolate have a long history as independently popular foodstuffs, and
            neither depends in any necessary, obvious, or even intuitive way on the other, yet their
            combination in a single product has proven impressively popular with consumers.
            Similarly, there is nothing about a DBMS that requires or expects CMS services, and vice
            versa, yet the growing integration of the two types of functionality within eXist-db
            confirms that they can be combined to create a resource for developing and deploying
            digital editions.</para>
        <para>With the release of TEI Publisher 4.0 in December 2018 [<xref
                linkend="teiPublisher4.0"/>], built on a Web Components foundation [<xref
                linkend="webComponents"/>], eXist-db can be said to provide a hosting platform for
            digital editions that both goes very far beyond traditional DBMS services and provides
            functionality that would normally be expected from a CMS. The TEI Publisher
            documentation says as much explicitly (see especially the paragraph below the numbered list):<blockquote>
                <para>Despite its elegant simplicity, various projects we realized in the past prove
                    that the TEI Processing Model is: <blockquote>
                        <para>1. powerful enough to cover complex transformation needs</para>
                        <para>2. a truly universal tool for any kind of digital edition</para>
                        <para> 3. efficient and as fast (or faster) as handwritten
                            transformations</para>
                        <para>4. suitable for any XML, not just TEI (this documentation is written
                            in docbook!)</para>
                    </blockquote>However, online editions require more than just a text
                    transformation: the text needs to be embedded into an application context,
                    adding navigation, pagination, search, facsimile display and so on. The larger
                    part of TEI Publisher deals with those aspects, providing all the necessary
                    building blocks for an online edition. [<xref linkend="teiPublisherQuick"
                    />]</para>
            </blockquote></para>
        <para>After a digression about model—view—controller (MVC) architecture, which serves as a
            reference point for comparison and discussion, in the following sections we describe
            four models for integrating digital edition content into eXist-db. These are, in
            increasing order of eXist-db dependence: <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>using Apache [<xref linkend="apache"/>] and PHP [<xref linkend="php"/>] to
                        mediate between the user and eXist-db, so that eXist-db provides only DBMS
                        services;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>the eXist-db app framework without HTML templating [<xref linkend="webapp"
                        />];</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>the eXist-db app framework using HTML templating [<xref

                    <para>TEI Publisher [<xref linkend="teiPublisher"/>].</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>Each of these ways of conceptualizing and implementing the infrastructure
            for a digital edition has advantages and disadvantages, primarily from the perspective
            of sustainability. Those concerns are applicable to digital edition frameworks
            generally, and are therefore not specific to eXist-db.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Model—View—Controller architecture (MVC)</title>
        <para>MVC is an architecture that separates an applicaation into three components: Model,
            View, and Controller. The following explanation is based on <xref linkend="mvc"/>): <itemizedlist>

                    <para><emphasis role="bold">View:</emphasis> the user interface (UI), such as
                        web forms that accept user input and the HTML returned to the user in

                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Controller:</emphasis> The interface between the
                        model and the view. The controller may translate user-supplied values from a
                        web form (part of the view) into a database query (interacting with the
                        model) and return the results (drawn from the model) as an HTML page (part
                        of the view).</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>These components and the relationships among them may be represented as

        <para>The Model in all of the examples below is the XML data stored inside eXist-db and the
            core eXist-db database functionality that interacts with the data (e.g., the ability to
            interpret XQuery and navigate collections and resources). The View in all of the
            examples is the UI, that is, web pages as presented to the user, both those that elicit
            user input (such as query forms) and those that respond to user input (such as formatted
            results returned from a query). The most variable aspect of the examples below is the
            Controller, that is, the part of the architecture that 1) responds to user interaction
            with the View by interacting with the Model and 2) updates the View in response to user
            activity, often recruiting and manipulating user-specified information retrieved from
            the Model.</para>

                script when the user hits a Submit button or otherwise causes an event to happen
                thaat initiates processing. The PHP script then harvests form data submitted by the
                user and interacts with a DBMS, retrieves the necessary information, shapes it into
                HTML, and returns it to the user in the context of a web page.</para>
